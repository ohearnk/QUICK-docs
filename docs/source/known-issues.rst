Compile time
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Compiling CUDA/MPI+CUDA versions for Kepler GPUs using CUDA v11.0 or higher
******************************************************************************

NVIDIA has dropped support for sm_30 microarchitecture starting from CUDA
v11.1, and support for sm_35 and sm_37 starting from CUDA v12.0.  However,
QUICK build systems still use sm_30/sm_35/sm_37 flags in NVCC compiler flag
list for CUDA v11 or higher toolkits if the user specifies Kepler as target
microarchitecture (i.e. --arch kepler, -DQUICK_USER_ARCH=kepler in legacy and
CMake builds respectively). This will lead to a compile time error.

Solution: Manually ensure that the installed CUDA version supports the correct
Kepler targeted microarchitectures (<= v11.0 for sm_30, <= v11.8 for
sm_35/sm_37).  Please consult the Release Notes for your installed CUDA SDK
version for further details on supported GPU microarchitectures.

Runtime
^^^^^^^

1. Out of memory error in CUDA code
***********************************

.. code-block:: none

 cudaMalloc cuda_buffer_type :: Allocate failed!: out of memory in gpu_type.h at line 590

or

.. code-block:: none

 gpu_get2e.cu.getGrad.358: 0x2 (out of memory)

The above memory allocation errors are observed in CUDA version when the
available global memory of the device is insufficient.  

Solution: Use a device with more global memory. Also make sure not to execute
other codes on the GPU while running QUICK.

2. Accuracy of gradients on old gaming cards
********************************************

When computing gradients using CUDA/MPI+CUDA versions on old gaming cards
(e.g., from Kepler and Maxwell microarchitectures), the resulting gradients may
be less accurate if the default density matrix cutoff (1.0E-6) is used. 

Solution: Tighten the cutoff value to 1.0E-7 or 1.0E-8.

3. SAD guess producing wrong results
************************************

The SAD guess refactored after QUICK-21.03 release produces wrong results.
The old SAD guess routines were replaced after release of QUICK-21.03.
This was done because the old SAD guess is extremely inefficient.
However, the new SAD guess produces wrong results. Thus, the users should only
use the basis sets provided in the User Manual. For those basis sets we have
precomputed the guess.
